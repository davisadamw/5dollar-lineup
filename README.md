# 5dollar-lineup
Basically just some code to pick a team from: https://twitter.com/DALLASBRADEN209/status/1090308102908342272

Lineups will be selected based on:
* Career WAR/WAA
* top season
* WAR/WAA per 162games
* median full season
* mean for top 7 seasons (inspired by JAWS)


All the data here comes from baseball-reference.com ... they're the best

Hat tip to https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-add-war-metrics-to-your-lahman-database/ for finding where baseball-reference makes its WAR accessible
